 <para>
   <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> started its life as a personal
   project by Tatsuo Ishii.  In the project it was just a simple
   connection pooling software. So the
   name <productname>Pgpool</productname> came from the fact.  The
   first version was in public in 2003.

 <para>
   In 2004, <productname>Pgpool</productname> 1.0 was released with
   the native replication feature (SQL statement based
   replication). In the same year 2.0 was released with load
   balancing, and support for version 3 frontend/backend protocol. In
   2005, automated fail over and master slave mode support were added.

 <para>
   In 2006, <productname>Pgpool</productname>
   became <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>. The first release 1.0
   eliminated many of restrictions
   in <productname>Pgpool</productname>, for example the number
   of <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> servers was up to 2 in
   <productname>Pgpool</productname>. Also many new features such as
   parallel query mode and PCP commands (PCP stands for "Pgpool
   Control Protocol") were added. Probably the most important change
   made between <productname>Pgpool</productname>
   and <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> was that the project was
   changed from a personal project to a group project owned by the
   Pgpool Developement Group.
